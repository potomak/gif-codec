# Contributing

Fork, then clone the repo:

Continuously build a development version of the bundle:

Once you're finished with your work, push to your fork and [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/potomak/gif.js/compare/).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* write tests
* be consistent
* write a [good commit
  message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
